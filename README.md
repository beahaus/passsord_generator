# passsord_generator

We were tasked with developing an app that would generate a unique, secure password based upon user specifications: length and inclusion or exclusion of lowercase, uppercase and special characters.

## Creation 

1. A HTML layout and specific CSS styling was provided. 

2. Using Javascript, asked for user input of length and inclusion or exclusion of lowercase, uppercase and special characters.

3. Created event listener for button function that would initiate the generate password function. 

## Addition

- As a personal addition, I created an aditional button that would copy the user's unique password to their clipboard for easy paste functionatlity.
